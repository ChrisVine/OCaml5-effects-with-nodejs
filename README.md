Using OCaml-5 effects with nodejs
=================================

This is an experimental repository for using OCaml-5 effects with
nodejs.

As a proof of concept, it is very basic and is based on the use of
Python-style generators, but can be substantially elaborated.

Of the examples in examples.ml and async_funcs.ml, the one using
nodejs's http.ClientRequest API does not at present work correctly as
of js_of_ocaml-5.1.1.  This appears to be due to a bug in
js_of_ocaml's code generation when using the `--enable=effects`
option: the http.ClientRequest code as generated by js_of_ocaml does
not run under node when js_of_ocaml is given that option, even when
the code is written in nodejs callback style without any use of
effects.
